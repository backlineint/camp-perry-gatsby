We don't care what the calendar says, Sunday April 7 is Easter. Visit Camp Casey (one of many official Camp Perry satellite locations) for the 2019 Eggstravaganza.

Festivities start at 3 or 3:30 pm (the text message thread hasn't reached a conclusion.) Camp aged children should prepare to hunt for eggs until their baskets explode. Adults should bring a savory snack and four beers (or La Croix) for the adult egg hunt.

### Eggstravaganza!
